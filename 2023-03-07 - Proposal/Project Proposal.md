This GDMC Minecraft project will consist of a Village/Small town type rural settlement.
This small town will consist of a colony that will have houses and buildings that one would normally see in a small town.
These settlements will be inspired by some small towns/ villages in Newfoundland since the ares can be hilly and flat lands.
These houses will be organized properly so they do not look like they were placed at random.
The code will be artificially intelligent to not put a lot of houses in a small area so that the colony doesn’t look so cluttered.
These houses will have main doors and windows and in addition to that, they will also consist of a bedroom with a bed and some other detailing inside.

There will also be rocky “man-made” paths from one house to another.
It will also consist of the main intersection that parts the colony.
The dimensions of the houses are going to differ from house to house as they will have a random minimum and maximum area values (which will be set by the code at runtime.
I will be using A* and the minimum spanning tree algorithm in order to find the shortest path from one house to the other. 
In the colony, I will have structures like small gardens outside the houses.
The whole settlement will have a fence built around it to separate it from the rest of the area.
There will be a main entry point somewhere in the fence to enter the “village”.
This entry point will of course be in line with the setting of the rest of the village.
The main partition in the middle of the colony will act as a highway (inspired by the town of Grand Falls Windsor).
I will also add different terrains to show a hill and a water body nearby.

Thank you.
